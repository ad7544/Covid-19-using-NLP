By- Aviral Chauhan, Kuldeep Singh

The entire world today is suffering from COVID-19 or the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Many researchers are trying to develop models to predict the course of the virus spread. Machine Learning algorithms has seen its application in analyzing and forecasting the impact of this virus on human beings. The predictive power of these learning models is mitigated by the unreliability of the information, personal stakes and other factors. This article introduces a novel framework that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) as a part of predictive model. This is an information-driven methodology with high accuracy and high efficacy that aids to initiate proactive reaction from the government and the citizens.
